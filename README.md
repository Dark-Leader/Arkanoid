# Arkanoid
Arkanoid game in Java

There are 4 levels supported in the game, the user may choose which levels he wants to play and the order
of the levels by providing them as command line arguments. ( if no arguments are provided the default
configuration is 4 levels one after the other. you may play any level more than once and consecutively).

for example if the user provides "1 2 3 4" as command line arguments then the order will be 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4. 

or "2 3 1 1 4 3 3 4 2" will translate to 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2.
